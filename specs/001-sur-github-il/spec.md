# Feature Specification: Hybrid Predictive Rendering System

**Feature Branch**: `001-sur-github-il`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "sur github il y a l'issue #6 prend le besoin pour faire les spec"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ GitHub issue #6 identified: "=. Performance: Hybrid Predictive Rendering"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: players, server, client rendering system
   ’ Actions: predict movement, interpolate states, reconcile with server
   ’ Data: game states, player inputs, timestamps
   ’ Constraints: 60 FPS rendering, network latency tolerance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flow: smooth gameplay experience despite network conditions
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (game states, predictions, inputs)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Implementation details noted and marked for removal from business spec
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Players in a multiplayer ChuChu Rocket game experience smooth, responsive gameplay at 60 FPS regardless of network conditions. When a player places an arrow or moves their character, they see immediate visual feedback without waiting for server confirmation. The game maintains visual fluidity even during network lag spikes, ensuring an uninterrupted gaming experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a player is in an active game with 200ms network latency, **When** they place an arrow direction, **Then** the arrow appears instantly on their screen and the game continues rendering at 60 FPS
2. **Given** multiple players are moving simultaneously with varying network conditions, **When** the server sends authoritative updates, **Then** all players see consistent game state without visual stuttering
3. **Given** a player experiences temporary network interruption, **When** connectivity is restored, **Then** their game state smoothly reconciles with the server without jarring corrections

### Edge Cases
- What happens when client prediction significantly diverges from server reality?
- How does the system handle complete network disconnection and reconnection?
- What occurs when the server becomes temporarily overloaded?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain 60 FPS rendering rate regardless of network latency up to 500ms
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide immediate visual feedback for player actions without waiting for server confirmation
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically reconcile differences between predicted and authoritative game states
- **FR-004**: System MUST reduce network traffic by at least 20% compared to current implementation
- **FR-005**: System MUST reduce server computational load by at least 30% compared to current implementation
- **FR-006**: System MUST support up to 32 concurrent players with predictive rendering enabled
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle network interruptions gracefully without crashing or corrupting game state
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide smooth visual interpolation between server state updates
- **FR-009**: Players MUST be able to see their own actions immediately even during network lag
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain game fairness by preventing client-side cheating through authoritative server validation

*Clarifications needed:*
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle rollback corrections [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum acceptable visual rollback distance for user experience]
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist player actions during disconnection [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how long should actions be buffered during network outage]
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide performance monitoring [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what metrics should be exposed to administrators vs players]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Game State**: Authoritative snapshot containing all entity positions, game objects, and player scores at a specific timestamp
- **Prediction State**: Client-calculated game state based on local input and interpolation between server updates
- **Player Input**: User actions (arrow placement, movement commands) with timestamps for prediction and rollback
- **Reconciliation Event**: Correction applied when client prediction diverges from server authority beyond acceptable threshold
