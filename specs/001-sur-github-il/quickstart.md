### Scenario 4: Rollback and Correction
**Objective**: Validate rollback netcode under prediction divergence

**Setup**:

3. Monitor rollback frequency and visual impact

**Test Steps**:
1. Player performs action that will diverge from server reality
2. **Expected**: Initial predicted outcome displays immediately
3. **Expected**: Server correction arrives and is applied smoothly
4. **Expected**: Visual correction is imperceptible (< 50ms smoothing)
5. **Expected**: Player input continues to be processed correctly

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Rollback correction applied within 50ms
- ✅ Visual correction appears smooth, not jarring
- ✅ Player maintains control throughout correction
- ✅ Game state accuracy restored to server authority

**Performance Metrics**:
- Rollback frequency: < 5 per minute per player
- Correction smoothing: 16-50ms visual transition
- Accuracy restoration: 100% server state alignment
- User experience: No noticeable interruption

### Scenario 5: Performance Monitoring Validation
**Objective**: Verify performance monitoring and alerting system

**Setup**:
1. Enable performance monitoring dashboard
2. Configure performance thresholds
3. Create load conditions to trigger alerts

**Test Steps**:
1. Access performance monitoring API endpoints
2. **Expected**: Real-time metrics available and accurate
3. **Expected**: Client metrics aggregated correctly
4. **Expected**: Performance alerts trigger at configured thresholds
5. **Expected**: Historical data tracked and retrievable

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Alerts trigger correctly for threshold violations
- ✅ Dashboard displays real-time system status

**Performance Metrics**:
- API response time: < 100ms
- Metrics accuracy: ±5% of actual values

### Scenario 6: System Recovery and Resilience
**Objective**: Test system behavior under failure conditions

**Setup**:
1. Configure temporary network disconnection simulation
2. Prepare server restart scenario
3. Monitor client behavior during disruptions

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate temporary client network disconnection
2. **Expected**: Client continues predictive rendering during disconnect
