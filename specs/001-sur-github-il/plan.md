3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
   → ✅ Constitution template found - minimal complexity constraints
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ No constitutional violations detected
   → ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ⏳ Research needed for predictive rendering architecture
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md update
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement a hybrid predictive rendering system for ChuChu Rocket multiplayer game that achieves 60 FPS client-side rendering with server-authoritative validation. The system will separate rendering logic from game logic, enable client-side prediction and interpolation, reduce server load by 30% and network traffic by 20%, while maintaining game integrity through rollback netcode.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.2.2, Node.js (current setup)
**Primary Dependencies**: WebSocket (ws 8.14.2), Protobuf (protobufjs 7.5.3), HTML5 Canvas, Webpack 5.89.0
**Storage**: In-memory game state with protobuf serialization
**Testing**: TypeScript compilation only (no formal test framework configured)
**Target Platform**: Node.js server + modern web browsers (HTML5 Canvas)
**Project Type**: web - Node.js backend + browser client interfaces
**Performance Goals**: 60 FPS client rendering, <500ms latency tolerance, 20% network reduction, 30% server load reduction
**Constraints**: Real-time multiplayer (up to 32 players), WebSocket communication, authoritative server validation
**Scale/Scope**: Current codebase ~50 files, 32 concurrent players, real-time game state synchronization

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitutional Requirements**:
- Template constitution found - no specific project constraints defined
- Standard software engineering principles apply
- No constitutional violations identified for this feature

✅ **PASS**: No complexity violations detected

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 - maintains existing TypeScript monorepo structure while adding new predictive rendering components

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Identified
1. **Client-Side Prediction Patterns**: Best practices for game state prediction in web applications
2. **WebSocket Batching Optimization**: Efficient state synchronization techniques for real-time games
3. **Canvas Rendering Performance**: 60 FPS rendering optimization techniques for HTML5 Canvas
4. **Rollback Netcode Implementation**: Conflict resolution patterns for client-server divergence
5. **State Interpolation Algorithms**: Smooth transition techniques between authoritative states
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics collection for hybrid systems

### Research Areas
- **For client-side prediction**: How to implement prediction without compromising server authority
- **For state synchronization**: Delta compression and efficient update mechanisms
- **For rollback handling**: User experience best practices for visual correction
- **For performance monitoring**: Metrics to track rendering performance and network efficiency

**Output**: research.md with comprehensive findings on predictive rendering architecture

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

### Design Artifacts to Generate
1. **Data Model** (`data-model.md`):
   - AuthoritativeGameState: Server-side canonical state
   - PredictiveGameState: Client-side predicted state
   - PlayerInput: Timestamped user actions
   - StateReconciliation: Rollback correction events
   - PerformanceMetrics: Rendering and network monitoring

2. **API Contracts** (`/contracts/`):
   - Enhanced WebSocket message protocols
   - State synchronization endpoints
   - Performance monitoring APIs
   - Player input validation contracts

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Prediction accuracy validation
   - Rollback behavior verification
   - Performance threshold testing
   - Multi-player synchronization scenarios

4. **CLAUDE.md Update**:
   - Add predictive rendering architecture notes
   - Document new component responsibilities
   - Update build and testing guidance

**Output**: Complete design documentation ready for task generation

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- **Core Infrastructure**: Separate rendering from game logic, create prediction engine
- **Client Enhancement**: Implement prediction, interpolation, and rollback in browser clients
- **Server Optimization**: Reduce tick rate, implement delta compression, enhance batching
- **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics collection and monitoring dashboards
- **Integration Testing**: Validate prediction accuracy and performance improvements

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: Infrastructure separation (prediction engine, state management)
- **Phase 2**: Client-side prediction implementation
- **Phase 3**: Server optimization and delta compression
- **Phase 4**: Rollback netcode and conflict resolution
- **Phase 5**: Performance monitoring and validation

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks covering complete hybrid rendering implementation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation following TDD principles with performance validation
**Phase 5**: Load testing with 32 concurrent players and latency simulation

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*
